W01-1404.xml,"Some of these studies have concentrated on finite-state or extended finite-state machinery, such as (Vilar and others, 1999), others have chosen models closer to context-free grammars and context-free transduction, such as (Alshawi et al., 2000; Watanabe et al., 2000; Yamamoto and Matsumoto, 2000), and yet other studies cannot be comfortably assigned to either of these two frameworks, such as (Brown and others, 1990) and (Tillmann and Ney, 2000)."
